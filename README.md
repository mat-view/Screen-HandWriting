# Screen-HandWriting
This is an image database of screen-handwritten digits.

It's well-known that MNIST is the main image database of handwritten digits. But there's a big difference between handwriting by pens and by fingers on screens. If we use the training set of MNIST to predict digits writting on phones by fingers, the result would be bad.

So we're gathering these screen-handwritten digits and make it opensource.

Hope it helps.
